Examples
===================

The examples can be used to fully trace all steps from loading the data to training a model using python.
The first two examples show how to preprocess the the data, either in grid or point cloud format using python.
The third example shows how to normalize the data, which is an important step before training a model.
The fourth example shows how to train a model using the preprocessed data and including a normalization step.
